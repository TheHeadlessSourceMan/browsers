This is intended to be a wrapper around standalone web browsers and common python web browser controls.

The idea is you specify what features you need, e.g:
 * transparency
 * javascript
 * screenshots
 * ability to directly set html
 * etc...
 
And then it locates the best available browser for your needs.
